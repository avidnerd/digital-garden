#### **America Turns Outward**

Americans felt that expansion to overseas markets might provide relief to the labor violence and agrarian unrest that existed in the country. Americans also felt emboldened with a new sense of power generated by the growth in population, wealth, and productive capacity.

Reverend Josiah Strong's _Our Country:  Its Possible Future and Its Present Crisis_ inspired missionaries to travel to foreign nations.

Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan's book of 1890, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660-1783, argued that control of the sea was the key to world dominance; it stimulated the naval race among the great powers.

Secretary of state, James G. Blaine published his **"Big Sister" policy** tried to get the Latin American countries to open their markets to Americans.

Americans were prepared to go to war over many small disputes with other countries. This demonstrated the country's new aggressive mood.

The area between British Guiana and Venezuela had been in dispute for over 50 years.  Conflict between the British and Venezuela arose when gold was discovered in the contested area.

Secretary of state, Richard Olney, warned that if Britain went to war with **Venezuela**, then Britain would be violating the **Monroe Doctrine**. When Britain disregarded this warning, President Cleveland threatended war.

Britain was pre-occupied with other potential wars in Europe, so they chose to avoid a new war and reconcile with the United States. The **Great Rapprochement**, or reconciliation, between the United States and Britain became a cornerstone of both nations' foreign policies.

#### **Spurning the Hawaiian Pear**

The first New England missionaries reached **Hawaii** in **1820**.

Beginning in the 1840s, the State Department warned other countries to stay out of Hawaii.  In **1887**, a treaty with the native government guaranteed **naval-base rights** at Pearl Harbor.

**Sugar imports** from Hawaii became less profitable with the **McKinley Tariff of 1890**.  American planters decided that the best way to overcome the tariff would be to annex Hawaii. Queen Liliuokalani insisted that native Hawaiian should control the islands.

In 1893, Americans successfully overthrew the Queen. Most Hawaiians did not want to be annexed, though, so President Grover Cleveland decided to delay annexation of Hawaii.

#### **Cubans Rise in Revolt**

Cubans revolted against Spanish rule in 1895.  Cuban **insurrectos** burned sugar canefields believing that if they destroyed enough of Cuba, then Spain might abandon Cuba or the United States might move in and help the Cubans with their independence. The Spanish put Cubans in **reconstruction camps** so they could not support the insurrectos.

America had a large investment and conducted substantial trade with Cuba.

Congress passed a resolution in **1896** that recognized the revolting Cubans.  President Cleveland opposed imperialism and he said that he would not go to war with Spain over Cuba.

**The Mystery of the** _**Maine**_ **Explosion**

William R. Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer used "**yellow journalism**" to inflate the anger of the American people over the crisis in Cuba.

On **February 15, 1898**, the American ship, **_Maine_** blew up in the Havana port.  The Spanish claimed it was an accident (spontaneous combustion in one of the coal bunkers), while the Americans claimed that Spain had sunk it.  The American people did not believe the Spanish, and war with Spain became imminent.

Spain had agreed to the Americans' 2 basic demands: an end to the reconstruction camps and an armistice with Cuban rebels.

Although President McKinley did not want a war with Spain, the American people did.  He conceded to the American people, and he sent his war message to Congress on **April 11, 1898**.  Congress declared war and adopted the **Teller Amendment**.  It said that _when_ the United States had beaten the Spanish, the Cubans would be free.

#### **Dewey's May Day Victory at Manila**

The Spanish military significantly outnumbered the American army, but American naval ships were in much better condition than the Spanish.

Commodore George Dewey's 6-ship fleet attacked Spain's **Philippines** on **May 1, 1898**. Dewey **attacked** **and** **destroyed** the 10-ship Spanish fleet at **Manila**.

German ships threatened to attack Dewey's ships in the Manila harbor (claiming that they wanted to protect German nationals). After several incidents, the potential for conflict with Germany blew over.

On **August 13, 1898**, American troops captured Manila.

With the victory in the Philippines, it was thought that Hawaii was needed as a supply base for Dewey.  Therefore, Congress passed a joint resolution of Congress to **annex Hawaii** on **July 7, 1898**.

#### **The Confused Invasion of Cuba**

Shortly after the outbreak of the war, the Spanish government sent a fleet of warships to Cuba, led by Admiral Cervera.  He was blockaded in the Santiago harbor in Cuba by American ships.

The "**Rough Riders**," was a regiment of American volunteers that was commanded by Colonel Leonard Wood and organized by Theodore Roosevelt.

The advancing American army caused the Spanish fleet to retreat from the Santiago harbor. Admiral Cervera's fleet was entirely destroyed on **July 3, 1898.** General Nelson A. Miles met little resistance when he took over **Puerto Rico**. 

On **August 12, 1898**, Spain signed an armistice.

Many more Americans had been killed by malaria, typhoid, and yellow fever than by bullets.

#### **America's Course (Curse?) of Empire**

Spanish and Americans met in Paris in 1898 to discuss terms to the end of the war.  The Americans secured **Guam** and **Puerto Rico**, but the **Philippines** presented President McKinley with a problem:  he didn't want to give the island back to the Spanish, but he also didn't want to leave the island in a state of disarray. 

McKinley finally decided to Christianize all of the Filipinos. Because Manila had been captured the day after the war, America agreed to pay Spain **$20 million** for the Philippines.

The treaty was controversial, especially in regards to the acquisition of the Philippines. The **Anti-Imperialistic League** fought McKinley's expansionist moves, in regards to the Philippines.

The **expansionists** argued that Americans have a duty to help the underprivileged people of the world.

The Senate **approved** the treaty on **February 6, 1899**.

#### **Perplexities in Puerto Rico and Cuba**

The **Foraker Act of 1900** gave the Puerto Ricans a limited degree of popular government. In 1917, they were granted U.S. citizenship.

The Supreme Court's rulings in the **_Insular Cases_** declared that the Constitution did not extend to the Philippines and Puerto Rico. 

The United States, honoring the Teller Amendment of 1898, withdrew from Cuba in **1902**.  The U.S. forced the Cubans to write their own constitution of 1901 (the **Platt Amendment**). The Cubans hated this document because it was written to benefit the Americans. The constitution decreed that the United States might intervene with troops in Cuba to restore order and to provide mutual protection.  The Cubans also promised to sell or lease needed coaling or naval stations to the U.S.

#### **New Horizons in Two Hemispheres**

Although the Spanish-American War only lasted 113 days, it increased American prestige around the world.

One of the greatest results of the war was the **bonding between the North and the South**.

#### **"Little Brown Brothers" in the Philippines**

The Filipinos thought that the treaty would give them their independence, like the Cubans. This was not the case and on February 4, 1899, the Filipinos started a rebellion against the occupying American forces.  The insurrection was led by Emilio Aguinaldo.

In **1901**, American soldiers captured the rebellion's leader, Emilio Aguinaldo, effectively ending the rebellion.

President McKinley appointed the **Philippine Commission** in **1899** to set up a Filipino government.  William H. Taft led the body.  He genuinely liked the Filipinos, while the American soldiers did not.

President McKinley's plan of "**benevolent assimilation**" of the Filipinos was very slow and it involved improving roads, sanitation, and public health.  The plan developed economic ties and set up a school system with English as the 2nd language. This system was hated by the Filipinos who preferred liberty over assimilation.

#### **Hinging the Open Door in China**

Following China's defeat by Japan in 1894-1895, several European powers move into **China**. Secretary of State John Hay released the **Open Door** note, which urged foreign powers to respect Chinese commercial rights.  **Russia** was the only major power to not accept it.

In **1900**, Chinese group known as the **"Boxers"** killed hundreds of foreigners in the **Boxer Rebellion**.  A multinational rescue force came in and stopped the rebellion.

After the failed rebellion, Secretary Hay declared in **1900** that the Open Door would include the respect of Chinese territory, in addition to its commercial integrity.

#### **Imperialism or Bryanism in 1900?**

President McKinley was the Republican presidential nominee for the **election of 1900** because he had led the country through a war, acquired rich real estate, established the gold standard, and brought prosperity to the nation.  McKinley and the Republican Party supported the gold standard and imperialism.

Theodore Roosevelt was nominated as the vice president.

William Jennings Bryan was the Democratic presidential candidate for the election.  Bryan and the Democratic Party supported the silver standard and anti-imperialism.  They proclaimed that the paramount election issue was Republican overseas imperialism. The Republican party proclaimed that Bryan would destroy the nation's prosperity once he took office with his free-silver policy and other "dangerous" ideas.

McKinley and the Republican Party won the election of 1900.

#### **TR:  Brandisher of the Big Stick**

In September **1901**, President McKinley was **assassinated**. Theodore Roosevelt took over the presidency. 

Roosevelt felt that the president should lead, boldly. He had no real respect for the checks and balances system among the 3 branches of government.  He felt that he may take any action in the general interest of the public that is not specifically forbidden by the Constitution.

#### **Building the Panama Canal**

The Americans wanted to build a canal through the Central American isthmus to allow ships to quickly cross from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. Because of friendly relations with Britain, Britain signed the **Hay-Pauncefote Treaty** in **1901**, which allowed the U.S. to build and fortify the canal.

Congress decided to build the canal through Panama. An offer to buy land for the canal had been **rejected by the Colombian senate**, who thought the U.S. monetary offer was too low.

The Panamanians feared the U.S. would choose the Nicaraguan route for the canal; Panama would miss out on a prosperity created by the canal's construction. So, on November 3, 1903, Panamanians successfully revolted against Columbian rule. The revolt was led by Bunau-Varilla. 

Bunau-Varilla became the Panamanian minister to the United States and signed the **Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty** in Washington.  The treaty gave the U.S. control of a 10-mile zone around the proposed Panama Canal.

The involvement in Panama marked a downward lurch in U.S.  relations with Latin America. 

In **1904** the construction of the **Panama Canal** began, and it was completed in **1914** at a cost of $400 million.

#### **TR's Perversion of Monroe's Doctrine**

Several Latin American countries were in debt to European countries.  Roosevelt feared that this would allow for future European involvement in Latin America, so he created a policy known as "**preventive intervention**."  The **Roosevelt Corollary** to the Monroe Doctrine declared that the U.S. could pay off the Latin American counties' debts to keep European nations out of Latin America.

Latin American countries hated the Monroe Doctrine because it had become the excuse for numerous U.S. interventions in Latin America.  In actuality, President Roosevelt was the one to blame for the interventions.

#### **Roosevelt on the World Stage**

**Japan** went to **war** with **Russia** in **1904** after Russia failed to withdraw troops from Manchuria and Korea. Roosevelt brokered a peace agreement in 1905 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The Japanese received no compensation for their losses and the southern half of Sakhalin.

Because of the treaty, friendship with Russia waned and Japan became a rival with America in Asia.

#### **Japanese Laborers in California**

Thousands of Japanese were recruited to work in California after the Japanese government lifted its emigration ban in 1884.  Japanese immigrants were confronted with racist hostility by whites.

In **1906**, San Francisco's school board segregated the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean students to make room for white students.  The Japanese saw this action as an insult and threatened with war. 

President Roosevelt stepped in and persuaded the Californians to repeal the segregation. The Japanese agreed to stop the flow of immigrants to the United States. This agreement was known as the "**Gentlemen's Agreement**."

In **1908**, the **Root-Takahira agreement** was reached with Japan.  The U.S. and Japan pledged themselves to respect each other's territorial possessions.

#### **The Dollar Goes Abroad as a Diplomat**

Taft encouraged Wall Street bankers to invest in foreign areas of strategic interest to the United States (**dollar diplomacy**).  American bankers thus strengthened American defenses and foreign policies, while bringing prosperity to America.

Japan and Russia controlled the railroads in China's **Manchuria.** President Taft feared that this monopoly would eventually hurt American merchants. In **1909**, Secretary of State Philander C. Knox proposed that Americans buy the Manchurian railroads and then turn them over to China.  Both Japan and Russia rejected the selling of their railroads.

# Chapter 29
#### **New Directions in Foreign Policy**

President Wilson was an anti-imperialist and he opposed an aggressive foreign policy.

He persuaded Congress in 1914 to repeal the Panama Canal Tolls Act of 1912, which had exempted American coastal shipping from tolls.  He also signed the Jones Act in 1916, which granted the Philippines territorial status and promised independence as soon as a stable government could be established.

When political turmoil broke out in Haiti in 1915, Wilson dispatched marines to protect American lives and property.  In 1916, he signed a treaty with Haiti that provided for U.S. supervision of finances and the police.

In 1917, Wilson purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark.

 
#### **Moralistic Diplomacy in Mexico**

In 1913, a Mexican revolution occurred and the Mexican president was murdered and replaced by General Victoriano Huerta. He was a brutal dictator. Because of the chaos in Mexico, millions of Spanish-speaking immigrants came to America.

President Wilson initially refused to directly intervene with the war in Mexico; he wanted the Mexican citizens to overthrow their government, themselves. After a small party of American sailors was accidentally captured by the Mexicans (Tampico Incident), Wilson ordered the navy to seize the Mexican port of Vera Cruz.

Just as war seemed imminent with Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile intervened and pressured Huerta to step down.

Venustiano Carranza became the president of Mexico.  Francisco Villa, rival to President Carranza, attempted to provoke a war between Mexico and the U.S by killing Americans.  Wilson ordered General John J. Perishing to break up Villa's band of outlaws.  The invading American army was withdrawn from Mexico in 1917 as the threat of war with Germany loomed.

In 1914, World War I broke out when the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary was murdered by a Serb patriot.  An outraged Vienna government (backed by Germany) presented a series of demands to Serbia.  Serbia (backed by Russia) refused to comply.  Russia mobilized its army, causing Germany to also mobilize its army.

France initially implied that it would be neutral in the Germany-Russia conflict. But, as Germany was bordered on both sides by potential enemies, it decided to first defeat France so that it could focus on fighting Russia. The Central Powers consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria.  The Allies consisted of France, Britain, Russia, Japan, and Italy.
