### Chapter 23: Political Paralysis in the Gilded Age

The Hayes-Tilden Standoff, 1876

- What efforts were made to keep Grant from running for a third term? There was a bipartisan vote in the House to prevent Grant from running for a third term because there was a tradition to only have two terms in order to avoid dictatorship/power for too long in the hands of one person.
    
- Why was Ohio so important? Ohio was a crucial swing state (could be a deciding factor in the election), which is mostly why the Republicans chose Rutherford B. Hayes (since he is from Ohio, it might increase chances of winning). Conkling and Blaine also neutralized each other.
    
- Hayes’ opponent was Samuel J. Tilden, who was most famous for putting away the political boss Boss Tweed in New York
    
- What happened in three of the states during the election of 1876? In Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana, voter fraud occurred and there were irregular electoral returns (both parties claimed victory). The issue was that if the votes were counted by the president of the Senate (a Republican), Republicans would win, and vice versa for the House. 
    
- What does the election of 1876 reveal about the nature of political corruption in the 19th Century? There was a lot of bribery, fraud, and corruption in the government during the Grant administration + the late 19th century.
    

The Compromise of 1877 & the End of Reconstruction

- How was the electoral dispute in 1877 resolved? 
    

- The Electoral Count Act was passed, where the Senate and House would count the votes together, and in a disputed state, the returns would be passed off to the electoral commission
    
- Hayes was granted the presidency as long as he withdrew federal troops in the South where they were still present (Louisiana and South Carolina) + gave support for a bill for construction of a railroad in the south. 
    

- What was the peace that was brought by the 1877 resolution? What was the price? The peace was that the nation did not break out into war (Democrats already started to assemble minutemen “Tilden or Blood”). The price was that Black equality was compromised (sacrificed black freedmen)
    

- The last attempt of the Radical Republicans was the Civil Rights Act, which prevented discrimination in jury selection and allowed for equal accommodations for Blacks and whites in public settings. However, this law was “toothless” from the beginning because it was deemed unconstitutional through the Civil Rights cases of 1883 (argument: the 14th amendment only prevented denial of Black civil rights by the government, but not by individuals.

The Birth of Jim Crow in Post-Reconstruction South

- The end of reconstruction meant what for both freedmen and poor whites? 
    

- Democratic “Redeemer” governments took over and allowed for Blacks to go into unemployment and be evicted.
    
- They were often reduced to sharecropping (could live on land in exchange for working on it), tenant farming (many of the landlords were the slaves’ former masters), and the crop-lien system (storekeepers gave credit for food and supplies in exchange for a bit of their harvest). 
    
- There were also state level systematic legal codes known as Jim Crow Laws. These were meant to segregate Blacks and whites as much as possible. In Plessy v. Ferguson, they declared that public railroad cars must be separate but equal (even though they were not equal).
    
- States (including northern states) also tried to exclude Blacks (and poor whites) from voting by implementing poll taxes (they were poor so they couldn’t pay), literacy requirements (they couldn’t get an education), and grandfather clauses (if your grandfather couldn’t vote, you couldn’t).
    

- What does the chart on page 513 reveal about the nature of race relations during the postwar South? The chart reveals that a record number of black people were lynched from 1890 to 1900, often because aggressive whites treated Blacks harshly for asserting themselves as equals or “violating the South’s racial code of conduct”.
    

  

Class Conflicts and Ethnic Clashes

- Kennedy mentions that 1877 marked the beginning of class warfare – what does he mean by this? Due to the panic of 1873, there was a lot of depression, deflation, and economic anxiety. Lower class workers were very scared and angry about the economic inequality that was occurring in the US at that time.
    
- What efforts did organized labor seek to gain recognition in this time period? When the presidents of the four largest railroad companies cut wages by 10%, the workers were outraged and decided to strike and stop working. There was massive unrest which was eventually put down by federal troops (100 people died)
    
- How did racial tensions increase during this time period? Many Asians came into America during the Gold Rush and comprised 9% of the population of California. Many came from the Guangdong province in China and were typically poor and male. When the Gold Rush subsided, around 50% of them left with their savings. The ones who stayed typically filled up menial labor positions and worked for very cheap wages. This caused a lot of tension with other immigrant groups (particularly the Irish) because they were also competing for cheap labor.
    
- How did the Kearneyites react with the arrival of Chinese to California? Denis Kearney was an Irishman who led a group of Irish people known as Kearneyites to basically terrorize the Chinese immigrants, in an attempt to drive them out and prevent them from taking the jobs of white people (were often called coolies - derogatory term). 
    
- Finally, the Page Act of 1875 targeted immigration of Chinese women and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first law passed that prevented immigration based on race. 
    
- Some whites even tried to strip American born Chinese people of their citizenship
    

- U.S. vs Wong Kim Ark - by the 14th amendment, people born in the US were guaranteed birthright citizenship (jus soli → right of the soil)
    

### Chapter 26: The Great West and the Agricultural Revolution

Introduction & The Clash of Cultures on the Plains

- What were the numbers regarding the First Nations’ population in 1860? It was about 360,000, most of them nomadic and scattered throughout the trans-Mississippi West.
    
- Was the clash with white pioneers “inevitable?” In some ways it was because the whites were rapidly industrializing and there was incentive to move westward, so there was bound to be conflict eventually.
    
- What dangers to First Nations’ existence did the white settlers bring with them? White settlers brought diseases such as typhoid, cholera, and smallpox. They also killed bison and allowed their own livestock to graze on the bison’s food.
    
- What was the objectives of the reservation system?
    

- The federal government tried to pacify the indian “chiefs” by signing treaties to establish territories for each tribe and split the Indians into north and south, the middle being for white settlers (through the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 and the Fort Atkinson Treaty of 1853)
    
- However, tribes and chiefs didn’t even exist because Native Americans were nomadic and the only remote authority was probably the local village elder. 
    
- The objective was to essentially consolidate the Indians and make way for white settlement without any hindrance
    

Receding Native Population

- How did “cruelty begot cruelty” as Kennedy described it? Aggressive white people would often shoot Native Americans for no reason just to ensure that they would not “cause any trouble”. One example is the Colonel Chivington Massacre, where his militia massacred 400 native Americans who were under the impression that they were promised immunity. Native Americans attempted to fight back. One key Indian triumph in the plains wars was the Fetterman massacre, when a Sioux war party tried to stop a railroad construction and ambushed William Fetterman’s command of 81 soldiers → massacred all of them.
    
- Describe the nature of the conflicts between whites and Native Americans. Almost all conflicts involved white people trying to take Native American Land:
    

- Battle of the Little Bighorn: Custer and his troops tried to take land from the Lakota (Sitting Bull was the Leader) and Cheyenne in Montana, but 2500 Indians wiped out his troops, leaving 1 survivor. 
    
- US authorities tried to bring the Nez Perce Indians onto a reservation, but Chief Joseph wanted to run away with around 700 Indians. Chief Joseph finally surrendered and instead of being taken to their ancestral lands of Idaho, they were forced to go to a reservation in Kansas.
    
- One of the hardest tribes to subdue was the Apache, led by Geronimo. They went from Arizona to Mexico after running away from federal troops and eventually surrendered and became farmers in Oklahoma
    

Bellowing Herds of Bison 🦬 

- How did the destruction of the Bison hasten the capitulation of the First Nations? The bison were key to the survival of the Native Americans. They were interfering with the railroads, so the white killed and butchered them, causing the population to decline rapidly.
    

The End of the Trail

- Describe how the 1880s relations began to change between First Nations and whites.

- How was the Homestead Act often a cruel joke?
    
- How did the farmers adapt to the realities of the “Great American Basin”? How did it turn out to be the cause for later disaster?

## Unit 2: A Reason To Believe

### Chapter 23: Political Paralysis in the Gilded Age

Garfield and Arthur

- What was the makeup of the Republican Presidential Ticket in 1880? How was it a source of potential conflict? Hayes was denounced, so they got someone from Ohio (Garfield) with running mate Chester A Arthur (had a reputation as a Stalwart - group of people who were supporting patronage). Garfield’s position was primarily related to race relations and civil rights. Winfield Scott Hancock was the Democratic nominee.
    
- What was the one positive result that happened because of Garfield’s assassination? Why was Arthur an unlikely instrument of reform?
    

One positive result was that when Chester A. Arthur became president, even though people were originally scared that he would champion the views of the Stalwarts, he ended up passing the Pendleton Act, which provided civil service examinations to make government jobs more selective (also known as the Civil Service Commission) and made mandatory campaign contributions from federal employees illegal. This ended up losing him the opportunity for reelection because Republicans were upset. He was also Conkling’s minion (Conkling was a powerful politician who basically controlled the state of New York - had control of the New York State Customs House, so he made a lot of money because he could get a portion of whatever came in. He was also the leader of the Stalwarts, who were in opposition with Blaine and the Halfbreeds), so he was expected to have Conkling’s henchmen take up office positions.

- How effective was civil service reform? It originally only affected 10% of federal jobs, but it did control the most blatant uses of patronage.
    
- Why was Arthur turned aside by the Republican Party in 1884? His integrity offended too many powerful republicans.
    

  

The Blaine-Cleveland Mudslinger of 1884

- Describe Blaine’s candidacy for the presidency in 1884. Blaine was known to have every political asset “except honesty” → many people thought he was corrupt. Because of this, some Republican reformers who did not want political corruption famously switched to the Democratic Party and supported Grover Cleveland (they were known as Mugwumps)
    
- Describe “Grover the Good.” Cleveland was the first democratic candidate to actually win in a long time (only democrat elected in the Gilded Age
    
- Kennedy maintains that, “personalities, not principles, claimed the headlines.” What does that mean? Mudslingers were making moral digs on other candidates rather than focusing on actual policy that the candidates would execute
    
- What role did Irish-Americans play in the election of 1884? The presidency depended on the state of New York, and a Republican said the Democratic Party was that of Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion. This insulted the Irish (who made a significant part of the New York population) and they supported Cleveland. 
    

  

“Old Grover” Takes Over

- How does Kennedy describe Cleveland (not just in physical terms)? Cleveland was the first Democrat to enter the White House since Buchanan, and people were scared that the “party of disunion” would mess stuff up 
    
- What was Cleveland’s attitude toward:
    

- Government intervention of the economy - laissez faire
    
- Civil service reform - he believed in the merit system but he owed the presidency to the people who helped him so he had no choice but to appoint “deserving democrats”
    
- The North-South Gap - narrowed the gap by appointing two former confederates to his cabinet
    
- Military Pensions - a lot of people who didn’t deserve pensions were trying to grab for them; cleveland laboriously vetoed each bill
    

  

Cleveland Battles for a Lower Tariff

- What was Cleveland’s view on the tariff? He wanted a lower tariff because he thought it meant lower prices for consumers and less protection of monopolies _ less Treasury surplus
    
- The election of 1888 was going to hinge on what major issue? The tariff
    

  

The Billion Dollar Congress

- Describe the election results of 1888 with respect to the presidency and Congress. Benjamin Harrison won. Thomas B. Reed was the Speaker of the House and he dominated the “Billion Dollar Congress” → increased gov purchases of silver, added pensions on veterans. McKinley Tariff set the tariff to the highest ever
    
- While a high tariff was wanted by Republicans – what did a high tariff do to farmers? Tariff was bad for farmers because they had to buy pricey goods from companies that were protected
    
- The election of 1890 did what to the Republicans? It made them lose their majority in Congress

### Chapter 28: Progressivism and the Republican Roosevelt (1901 – 1912)

Introduction & Progressive Roots

- In the view of the progressives, what was wrong with American society? In the view of the Progressives, they felt that the republic and democracy were being destroyed because political bosses would control the vote and trusts/large corporations would shut out small businesses and monopolize industries
    
- What solutions did they propose to address social problems? Their main goal was to use the government as an agency for human welfare - essentially, they wanted to make government reforms to restore the republic and the promise of democracy for WASPs (white anglo saxon protestants).
    
- Why was progressive reform more attractive to middle-class Americans than the working classes or the wealthier segments of society? The current state of society was already favoring the wealthy elite and catering to the top 1% of concentrated wealth, especially those who owned large corporations and monopolies.
    
- What were the major sources of the Progressive movement? 
    

- They would often use social gospel - the idea of better housing and living conditions for urban poor with religious pretext - as a method of lobbying for change. 
    
- They wanted to control the trusts and limit monopolies.
    
- Writers would often use their voice to stand against large corporations
    

Raking Muck with the Muckrakers

- Why did journalistic “muckrakers” play such a large role in the progressive movement? Muckrakers would expose the evils of large corporations and poor working conditions in order to make people more aware of the state of corruption in America. They wanted to “cleanse” capitalism, and the way they could do that was igniting public conscience and having more democracy.
    
- Who and What were the targets of the muckrakers
	- Large trusts
	    
	- Railroad barons
	    
	- Life insurance companies who committed malpractice
	    
	- Social evils such as “white slave traffic” in women, child labor, and industrial accidents
	    
	- Quack doctors who sold garbage patent medicine
    

- Major people in the movement:
	- Ida B. Tarbell - worked on McClure’s with Lincoln Steffens + expose on Standard Oil
	    
	- David G Phillips said that most of the members of the Senate were representing railroads and trusts instead of the common people
	    
	- Ray Stannard Baker - wrote about the subjugation of Black people in industry
	    
	- John Spargo - wrote about abuses of child labor
	    

  

Political Progressivism

- According to the progressives, what was the cure for all of American democracy’s ills? Having more democracy
    
- What were the two main objectives of the progressives? They wanted to use state power to curb trusts and stem the socialist threat by improving living conditions of the common people.
    
- What was a third goal of the progressives? Another goal was to “root out graft”. This meant that they wanted to stop political corruption and bribery. In order to do this, they introduced the secret ballot/Australian ballot so it became harder for people to know who others actually voted for → reduced bribery. They also wanted to have direct election of US senators, especially since the current composition of senators was known as the “Millionaires’ Club” because everyone was rich. They eventually lobbied for the passing of the 17th amendment, which achieved this goal. 
    

  

They wanted to have direct participation in voting (direct primary elections to remove the influence of the political bosses). They favored three key principles:

- Initiative: voters can directly propose legislation to circumvent the power of bosses over the state legislatures
    
- Referendum: placed laws on the ballot for final approval by the people
    
- Recall: allow voters to remove faithless elected officials
    

  

Progressivism in the Cities and States

- Progressives focused on reform of public utilities in urban areas
    
- Robert M. La Follette: disassembled crooked lumber + railroad corporations in Wisconsin + improved public utilities
    
- Hiram W. Johnson: republican governor of California who also helped reduce influence of trusts on California politics
    

  

Progressive Women

- What were the distinctive contributions of feminists to the progressive movement? They formed trade unions and fought against issues such as child labor. They made two federal agencies in the US Dept. of Labor - CHildren’s Bureau and the Women’s Bureau. They also played a role in the temperance movement (formed the Women’s Christian Temperance Union)
    
- Muller v Oregon: Louis Brandeis persuaded Supreme Court to allow laws that protected women workers
    
- Lochner v. New York: invalidated a ten hour work day for bakers, but the Court later upheld this for factory workers
    
- Triangle Shirtwaist Factory: a fire set in the factory and many women jumped and died or were burned alive
    

  

TR’s Square Deal for Labor

- Would you classify Roosevelt as a radical, liberal, moderate or conservative? Why? TR was Radical because he advocated many reforms for the public interest (Pure Food and Drug Act and conserved over 230 million acres of natural resources). He also busted up trusts and monopolies through the antitrust policy and enforced the Sherman Antitrust act. He was very active/dynamic (“The midwife of the presidents”) and loved his job. He also believed in having big government influence (not just delivering the mail and protecting the borders)
    
- Identify the three C’s of Roosevelt’s Square Deal. 
    

- Conserve natural resources: This did not mean that they would PRESERVE the land, but conserve for later use. It led to the start of the environmentalist movement
    
- Consumer protection - made sure that consumers would actually get what they were paying for, especially in terms of medications
    
- Control the corporations - Roosevelt thought there were good trusts and bad trusts. He made sure that the trusts that stayed were for the good of the people (or at least tried to)
    

- How did the Square Deal succeed in its goal of using the federal government to mediate between powerful interests?
    
- Square Deal “acid test”:
    

- Anthracite Coal Strike: in 1902 a bunch of workers in a Pennsylvania coal mine decided to strike because they wanted a 20% increase in pay and reduction in working hours. 
    
- Winter was coming and coal supplies running out was dangerous, so Roosevelt invited them to come negotiate at the White house, but they refused to come
    
- Finally, Roosevelt threatened to operate the mines with federal troops → compromised with 10% pay increase
    
- As a result (conflict between capital and labor), Roosevelt set up the Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903 w/ the Bureau of Corporations → meant to probe businesses engaged in interstate commerce + control large companies
    

  

TR Corrals the Corporations

- TR was often labeled as the “trust-buster.” How accurate is this reputation? Although TR did bust a lot of trusts, he did not uniformly try to eliminate trusts. He thought there were good and bad trusts. He would allow trusts that would help the public and were good for the economy (he let J.P Morgan’s U.S. steel company merge with Tennessee Coal and Iron company to save the economy during the Panic of 1907). However, he did eliminate the trusts that he thought were greedy and bad for the public (such as the Northern Securities Company)
    
- Elkins Act = prevented railroad companies from giving rebates to businesses that ship a lot of goods/benefit them
    
- Hepburn Act = allowed the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroads
    

  

Caring for the Consumer

- How did consumer protection reveal the progressive soul? The Progressives emphasized caring for the consumers. When the horrors of the meatpacking industries were exposed by foreign countries and muckrakers (notably Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle), a nauseated Roosevelt helped pass the Meat Inspection Act, which required the preparation of meat to be inspected by federal officials. A companion to this act was the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the adulteration/mislabeling of food and pharmaceutical products.
    

  

Earth Control

- How did environmentalism reveal the progressive soul? Roosevelt saved over 125 million acres of trees from being cut down (3x that of his predecessors). Progressives wanted the nation’s birthright (nature) to “stop being squandered’. The federal government also passed legislation such as the Desert Land Act that would encourage people to irrigate arid land by selling it at a cheap price. Pinchot was also a conservationist who was the head of the federal division of Forestry. 
    

- One battle that they lost was when the federal government allowed San Fransisco to build a dam at Hetch Hetchy Valley (idk which weirdo came up with that name 💀)
    

- Why did TR consider conservation perhaps his greatest achievement as president? Idk maybe it helped set a precedent for the environmentalist movement + conserving nature for future use?
    

  

The “Roosevelt Panic” of 1907

- How did TR make a tactical mistake during the night of his election? He sadi he definitely would NOT run for a third term, which ended up decreasing his popularity (“the king’s power wanes if people know he will be dead in three years”)
    
- What did the Panic of 1907 do for both Roosevelt and the financial industry? The Panic of 1907 resulted from a series of bad banking decisions, and JP Morgan + other wealthy Wall street Bankers had to end up giving loans to the government to settle it. Many people blamed it on Roosevelt and it resulted in the federal bank being given the power to give out emergency currency backed by various types of collateral.
    

  

The Rough Rider Thunders Out

- Roosevelt is sometimes called the first modern president. Does this description fit? This description fits because Roosevelt was very involved in his job (when compared to previous presidents) and he would set a precedent for all future presidents after him.
    

  

Taft: A Round Peg in a Square Hole

- What were some of the major weaknesses of Taft’s personality that threatened his presidency? Taft was a very reluctant president - he wasn’t very stirring in the face of the public like TR was, and didn’t really care for politics. He was passive and a poor judge of public opinion. He was a milder Progressive than Roosevelt
    

  

Taft the Trustbuster

- What was Taft’s reputation as a trust-buster? Taft thought that all trusts were bad and busted a LOT of them (90 in 4 years compared to Roosevelt’s 44 in 7.5 years). His doctrine from Sherman’s Antitrust act was any trust that “unreasonably” restrained trade was illegal. He busted the Standard Oil Company (notably) and the U.S. Steel COmpany (which made Roosevelt pissed)
    

  

Taft Splits the Republican Party

- Why was the tariff such a controversial issue during the Taft administration? Context: The Payne Aldrich Tariff was basically Taft being hypocritical because in his campaign he said that he would reduce tariffs. But the bill introduced by Senator Aldrich of Rhode Island had so many exceptions to the tariff reductions that only stuff like hides and sea moss had no tariffs attached. This annoyed the progressive wing of the party a lot.
    
- How did Taft handle conservation? Taft was an avid conservationist (arguably even more so than roosevelt. For example, he established the Bureau of Mines to control mineral resources. But he basically shot himself in the foot because of the Ballinger Pinchot Controversy:
    

- Secretary of the Interior Ballinger from Wyoming sold off public land for private profit (to corporations)
    
- Gifford Pinchot (Dept. of Forestry) was Roosevelt’s friend and got really mad at this
    
- Taft dismissed Pinchot for insubordination which made Roosevelt break off his friendship with Taft.
    

- How did the Congressional elections of 1910 further weaken Taft? Democrats won control in the Midterm elections, and progressives banded together (against Taft because he wasn’t progressive enough) 
    

  

The Taft-Roosevelt Rupture

- Is the claim that Taft abandoned Roosevelt’s policies accurate? Why? It is not exactly accurate. Taft just wasn’t as progressive as Roosevelt and disagreed with him on minor issues (he was all anti trusts, he was a little conservative - shown in the Joe Cannon controversy)
    
- How did TR get himself back into presidential politics in 1912? He wrote to seven state governors and said that he was going to run for a third term (adhering to the tradition of no three CONSECUTIVE terms)
    

  

### Chapter 29: Wilsonian Progressivism at Home and Abroad (1912 – 1916)

The “Bull Moose” Campaign of 1912

- Compare and contrast Roosevelt's New Nationalism and Wilson's New Freedom programs. Which seems to you to be the more realistic response to industrialization? Why? Wilson’s New Freedom program involved stronger antitrust legislation, banking reforms, and tariff reductions.  He favored small enterprises, entrepreneurship, and unmonopolized markets (democrats did not care for social welfare). Roosevelt focused on New Nationalism, which was the idea that big government was here to stay to regulate the trusts. Roosevelt agreed with the ideas of Herbert Croly (consolidation of trusts + labor unions, strong federal government). Also women’s suffrage and social welfare (minimum wage laws). Wilson’s idea that the government would stay strong until the trusts go away and then dissipate is pretty unrealistic. 
    

  

- Compare the issues and candidates in the presidential elections of 1912 and 1916. Account for Wilson's victory in each case. In the election of 1912, the reason Wilson won was because the Republican party was split among Roosevelt and Taft (other candidate was Eugene V. Debs - socialist)
    

  

Woodrow Wilson: A Minority President

- What were the electoral results of 1912? Wilson won, but Taft and Roosevelt combined had more votes than Wilson. Wilson and Roosevelt (progressives) also had more votes combined than Taft.
    
- Why was the Progressive Party such a failure? The progressive party fizzled out because it was basically a one man show (they had elected very few people to state and local offices, vs something like the Socialist party which elected upwards of 1000)
    

  

Wilson: The Idealist in Politics

- Critically evaluate Woodrow Wilson's personal qualities as well as his presidential leadership and policies. How did his personality affect his policies and their outcome? Wilson was a moralizing Presbyterian preacher. His father was heavily religious and that basically shaped the way he led the country as president. He believed that democracy was great, but only when people were ready for it. Some of his shortcomings were that he thought he was better than everyone and did not relate to the average person because he was so “smart”. He grew up in Civil War Virginia (first one to be from one of the seceded states since Z. Taylor), which shaped his views of non-WASPs (bad) and he sympathized with confederates. 
    

  

Wilson Tackles the Tariff

- What was the triple wall of privilege? Wilson heavily attacked the Triple Wall of Privilege:
	- Tariffs
	    
	- Banks
	    
	- Trusts

- In order to combat tariffs, he passed the Underwood Tariff, which resulted in a dramatic reduction of rates. Also introduced a graduated income tax as per the 16th amendment
    

  

Wilson Battles the Bankers

- Why was the Federal Reserve Act a “red-letter achievement?” The Federal Reserve Act basically set up the Federal Reserve, which oversaw a nationwide system of 12 regional banks. It basically helped establish economic + monetary stability in the US. It was a red letter achievement because it helped lead the country through later financial crises (such as the Great Depression and WWI)
    
- Arsene Pujo & Louis Brandeis were a congressman and Wilson’s lawyer (respectively) who fought for banking reform
    

  

The President Tames the Trusts

- Wilson helped pass the Clayton Antitrust Act, which basically extended the restriction of the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890)
    

  
  

Wilsonian Progressivism at High Tide

- What were the most important of Wilson's progressive reforms? Was Wilson actually a more effective progressive than Theodore Roosevelt? Why or why not? The most important part of his reforms might have been his social welfare legislation + bringing down the triple wall of privilege. He 
    
- Comment on the observation that Wilson's support for the flood of social—welfare legislation in 1916 was “hypocritical and self—serving.”
