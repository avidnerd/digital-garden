* How did most white Southerners regard the condition of Reconstruction? Why?

* What does Kennedy (the author) claim about the leaders of the US during Reconstruction with respect to their “vision” of it?

* How did the Republicans act with respect to Reconstruction?
 
* Kennedy maintains that the South wasn’t reconstructed, but was resurrected. What does that mean?
#### Reconstruction by the Sword
* Reconstruction Act - divided the South into 5 military districts, did not allow former confederates to vote
	* moderates wanted to create an electorate in the South to take the issue of Black rights out of federal hands
* In order to go back to the Union, seceded states had to ratify the 14th amendment (former slaves get to be citizens) + right to vote (DID NOT include giving freedmen land or education)
	* radical republicans were worried that states would amend their constitutions to prevent Black suffrage, so they passed the 15th amendment
* When federal troops left a state, "Redeemer Governments" (white Democrats) took over --> attempted to establish white supremacy and regain power

#### No Women Voters
* After the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments were passed, women were greatly against it because it was the first time the word "male" was put in reference of having equal national citizenship (14th)
* The women thought that the movement for black suffrage and women suffrage were combined, and the women fought hard for ending slavery and allowing black suffrage (women's loyal league)
* But when the time came, women thought it was "their deserved time", but were very angry with the wording of the 14th amendment ^^. Stanton and Anthony fought against it despite the pleas of Frederick Douglass (said it was the "negro's hour")

#### The Realities of Radical Reconstruction in the South
* Many moderate Republicans hesitated to give Black people the vote - they wanted them to have the same rights as women: citizenship with no suffrage
* South accused North of being hypocritical because they withheld the ballot from Blacks in Northern states, but wanted southern states to grant suffrage
* Black men began to assemble politically - they formed the Union League (a network of political clubs that campaigned from building Black churches+ schools, represented Black grievances)
* women took part in informal votes, rallies, and constitutional conventions
* black men served as delegates to constitutional conventions
* former slave owners accused scalawags (southerners who "plundered the treasury" through their influence in radical governments) and carpetbaggers (people who came from the North to profit off of the South's despair)
* Radical legislatures: public schools, public works, railroads, refined tax system, rights for women

#### The Ku Klux Klan
* terrorist group founded in Tennessee, aim was to establish white supremacy, "keep Blacks in their place"
* In response, Congress established the Force Acts to make federal troops settle the issues

#### Johnson Walks the Impeachment Plank
* Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act (president could not remove appointees until the Senate approves) --> Johnson dismissed Stanton anyway and was voted 126 - 47 to be impeached

#### A Not-Guilty Verdict for Johnson
* The radicals were not able to get a 2/3 majority to impeach Johnson
* Johnson said he would not obstruct Republican policies in exchange for staying in office

#### Purchase of Alaska
* Johnson biggest success was foreign relations
* Russians "were in a mood" to sell Alaska bc they overextended themselves in North America + they would rather have Alaska go to America than their enemy (Britain)
* Seward was very pro-expansionist and was very enthusiastic about the deal, but others mocked him ("Seward's Icebox" LMAOOO) and were focused on Reconstruction (economic-minded and anti expansionist)
* They still accepted "Seward's Polar Bear Garden"

#### The Heritage of Reconstruction
* Republicans acted from a mix of idealism (wanted to protect freedmen) and political expediency (bring good fortune to their party) --> backfired because their party was essentially extinguished
* People say the old South was "resurrected" rather than reconstructed because the rights given to Blacks were only fleeting

#### Varying Viewpoints: How Radical was Reconstruction?
* sympathy with white south - disgrace because it was just about the self serving intentions of Radical Republicans
