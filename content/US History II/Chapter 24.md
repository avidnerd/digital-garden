#### The Iron Cold Becomes an Iron Horse
* Transcontinental railroad building was very expensive and required subsidies from the government
* Congress advanced liberal money loans  + added large donations of acreage parallel to the tracks
* no such thing as laissez faire

#### Spanning the Continent with Rails
* There was a standoff on the proposed transcontinental railroad UNTIL the south seceded
	* argument to get started was to connect the union by binding the pacific coast to the rest of the country
	* would also facilitate trade with Asia
	* started the union pacific railroad
* Rails started to be added more aggressively after the Civil War
	* Crédit Mobiler was a construction company that made a lot of unfair profit + bribed congressmen to not care
* Indians would try to fight back but failed
* the "Big Four" were the financial backers of the rail laying enterprise
	* Leland Stanford (ex gov of Cali)
	* Collis P. Huntington (lobbyist)

#### Binding the Country with Railroad Ties
* 5 transcontinental railroads existed by the end of the 19th century - none received monetary loans from the government, but they did get land
* Some railroads were not successful because there weren't enough people in some areas to support a railroad
	* passed through bankruptcy, mergers, reorgs

#### Railroad Consolidation and Mechanization
* Vanderbilt - became successful in steam boating, later offered superior railroad services + made 100 million
	* also contributed 1 million to Vanderbilt University
	* replaced old iron tracks with steel rails (safer + more economical b/c it could carry heavy loads)
* Westinghouse air brake also improved efficiency
#### Revolution by Railways
* created a national domestic market for raw goods + manufacturing, led to industrialization
	* stimulated agriculture (helped farmers carry their goods nationwide, farms were next to railroads) and mining
* stimulated immigration (railroad companies wanted to sell their land grants for a profit --> "seductively advertised" in Europe)
* land was also impacted - settlers plowed the land, made the bison extinct, and chopped down trees which would be given to prairies farmers
* Development of time zones
#### Wrongdoing in Railroading
* There was a lot of corruption involved in railroad companies
	* stock watering - railroad companies would grossly exaggerate their line's assets + profitability so that the stocks were sold way higher than their real value
	* charged super high rates
	* robber barons like Vanderbilt didn't care about public opinion since they had the power
	* railroad kings were monarchs - had more power over people than the president, entered defensive alliances to protect profits
* Pool = agreement to divide the business in a given area + share profits
* Rail barons also gave money/kickbacks to ensure steady traffic
#### Government Bridles the Iron Horse
* people were afraid that slavery power turned to money power
	* farmers were especially affected
		* under pressure from agrarian groups, midwestern legislatures tries to regulate the monopoly
* Wabash case = Supreme Court declared that individual states had no power to regulate interstate commerce
* interstate commerce act = 
	* prohibited pools
	* railroads had to publish rates openly
	* SHORT HAULS CAN'T cost more than long hauls
	* no unfair discrimitation against shippers
	* ICC administered this legislation
	* provided an orderly forum for competing companies to "resolve their conflicts peaceably"
	* kennedy says it wasn't really used..?

#### Miracles of Mechanization
* US manufacturing status went form 4th in the world to first
* the word millionaire was coined
* natural resources in the US was used
* cheap labor immigrants were used for tasks like manufacturing steel
	* mostly from southern and eastern Europe, worked 12 hour shifts
#### The Trust Titan Emerges
* Horizontal integration: combining all competitors and merging them so that you don't have to have a competitive price
	* Rockefeller controlled over 90% of oil in the US
* trust = legal structures that allow a third party to hold and administer assets
	* large scale business combination
	* basically killed weaker competitors and resulted in monopoly
* Vertical Integration: combine all steps of the manufacturing process of a product into one company
	* Carnegie controlled all steel manufacturing processes

#### The Supremacy of Steel
* steel was king - steel making was "heavy industry", focused on making capital goods distinct from consumer goods
* by 1900 America produced more steel than GB and Germany combined
	* caused by the discovery of the Bessemer process (method of making cheap steel)

#### Carnegie and Other Sultans of Steel
* Carnegie's story
	* scottish person who was super poor and worked his way up the ladder
	* entered the steel business in Pittsburgh
	* was not a monopolist and did not like trusts --> had partners
	* produced 1/4 of Bessemer steel in the U.S. + no income tax
* JP Morgan
	* financed reorg of railroads, insurance companies, and banks
	* Wanted to go into steel pipe tubing but Carnegie threatened to go into the same business if Morgan didn't buy his holding for a good price
		* eventually got 400 million - Carnegie felt disgraced with so much money so he donated a lot
#### Rockefeller Grows and American Beauty Rose
* oil industry originally grew in Pennsylvania
	* kerosene was discovered and became a valuable export
* Rockefeller got into the oil business JUST as the automobile industry was introduced
	* wanted to squeeze out his competitors + monopolize
	* created a "giant American Beauty Rose"
* Other trusts like sugar, tobacco, and leather came with oil

#### The Gospel of Wealth
* defenders of capitalism such as Herbert Spencer supported social Darwinism + survival of the fittest
* Monopolists evaded state legislatures by using the interstate commerce clause
* Trusts sought refuge behind the 14th amendment 
	* corporation is a legal "person" and so it cannot be deprived of its property

#### Government Tackles the Trust Evil
* Resistance against the monopolies:
	* tried to control trusts through state legislation
	* passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890
		* prohibited combinations in restraint of trade, without distinction between good and bad trusts
		* wasn't even effective bc corps found loopholes, but it stopped labor unions from forming
