### Chapter 25: America Moves to the City

#### The Urban Frontier
- Post-Civil War, America experienced a rapid shift from rural to urban living, with the population increasing from 40 million in 1870 to nearly 76 million by 1900.
- Urban populations tripled during this time, with major cities like New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia surpassing one million residents by 1890.
- The construction of skyscrapers revolutionized urban architecture, allowing cities to expand upward. The first skyscraper was built in Chicago in 1885, and Louis Sullivan's design principles emphasized that "form follows function."
- Mass transit systems, including electric trolleys and subways, facilitated commuting and allowed residential areas to develop in outer suburbs, creating a distinct urban environment with segregated districts based on social class and ethnicity.
- The shift to urban life introduced new conveniences such as electricity, indoor plumbing, and telephones, enhancing the appeal of city living.
- The rise of department stores symbolized consumer culture, attracting shoppers and providing jobs, particularly to women, while also highlighting class disparities.

#### The New Immigration
- The United States saw an influx of immigrants, particularly from Southern and Eastern Europe during the late 19th century, with over 5 million arriving in the 1880s alone.
- These "New Immigrants" were largely from Italy, Poland, Greece, and other nations with little experience of democracy, often arriving impoverished and illiterate.
- Many settled in urban areas, creating ethnic enclaves such as "Little Italy" and "Polish neighborhoods," which provided cultural familiarity and community support.
- The New Immigrants faced challenges in assimilation, leading to fears among established Americans about cultural dilution and the rise of nativism.

#### Southern Europe Uprooted
- Conditions in Southern Europe, including population growth and insufficient resources, pushed many to seek opportunities abroad.
- American food imports and industrialization in Europe displaced many peasant farmers, exacerbating unemployment and prompting emigration.
- Letters from relatives already in America painted the U.S. as a land of opportunity, fueling the immigration wave.
- The experience of persecution, especially for Jews in Eastern Europe, also drove many to the U.S. for safety and a better life.

#### Reactions to the New Immigration
- Nativism surged as established Americans expressed fear and resentment towards the New Immigrants, leading to organized movements against immigration.
- Concerns over job competition and cultural differences prompted the rise of groups like the American Protective Association (APA) and calls for stricter immigration laws.
- Labor unions and some business leaders opposed immigration due to the influx of cheap labor undermining wage standards and working conditions.
- Over time, these reactions laid the groundwork for immigration restrictions and policies designed to limit the entry of certain ethnic groups.

#### Narrowing the Welcome Mat
- The first federal immigration law in 1882 restricted entry for paupers, criminals, and convicts, marking a shift toward more exclusionary policies.
- The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first significant law to target a specific ethnic group, reflecting growing anti-Chinese sentiment.
- Subsequent legislation continued to expand the list of excluded groups, including the insane, polygamists, and individuals with contagious diseases.
- Nativist sentiments culminated in the 1917 literacy test, aimed at favoring older immigrants over new arrivals.

#### Churches Confront the Urban Challenge
- The massive urban migration challenged traditional religious institutions, particularly Protestant churches, which struggled to remain relevant in rapidly changing environments.
- Many churches focused on material wealth, leading to criticism that they had become disconnected from the social needs of urban communities.
- The "social gospel" movement emerged, spearheaded by clergymen advocating for social justice and reform, emphasizing the need for churches to engage with the urban poor.
- Settlement houses, like Hull House founded by Jane Addams, arose as community centers providing social services and education to immigrants and the urban poor.

#### Darwin Disrupts the Churches
- Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, published in "On the Origin of Species" in 1859, challenged traditional religious beliefs and interpretations of the Bible.
- The reaction within religious communities was polarized, with fundamentalists rejecting Darwinism and modernists seeking ways to reconcile faith with new scientific ideas.
- This conflict sparked heated debates in churches and educational institutions, leading to divisions and the rise of "fundamentalism" in opposition to modernist theology.

#### The Lust for Learning
- The late 19th century saw a significant expansion in public education, with states increasingly adopting compulsory education laws.
- The number of high schools surged, and educational access for women and minorities improved, though still limited.
- The Chautauqua movement promoted adult education, offering lectures and courses to a broad audience, contributing to the desire for lifelong learning.
- The literacy rate dropped significantly, from 20% in 1870 to 10.7% by 1900, reflecting advancements in education.

#### Booker T. Washington and Education for Black People
- Booker T. Washington emerged as a leading advocate for African American education, emphasizing vocational training as a path to economic self-sufficiency.
- He established the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama in 1881, focusing on practical skills and trades to uplift the black community.
- Washington's philosophy of accommodation and gradualism faced criticism from contemporaries like W.E.B. Du Bois, who advocated for immediate civil rights and higher education.

#### The Hallowed Halls of Ivy
- The post-Civil War era witnessed a boom in higher education, with the establishment of numerous colleges and universities.
- The Morrill Act of 1862 provided federal land for educational institutions, leading to the creation of land-grant colleges focused on agriculture and mechanical arts.
