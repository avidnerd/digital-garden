--------

#### The Clash of Cultures on the Plains
* Migration and conflict between Native American Groups in the West
* White intruders spread diseases after westward expansion
* fed gov tried to sign treaties with "chiefs" of "tribe" (even though most native Americans were just nomadic) --> marked beginning of the reservation system (separated Indians into colonies in the north and south)
* Indians only surrendered after being promised supplies and food (but they were given deficient products)
* There was frontier warfare between Indians and the US army in the west (1/5 of all US Army personnel were Black)

#### Receding Native Population
* Aggressive wars w Native Americans in the West - Fetterman's command of soldiers were massacred by Indians in the Fetterman Massacre
* ended up being ghettoized on reservations --> "preserved cultural autonomy" but were considered "wards of the government"
* buffalo were exterminated --> killed nomadic life

#### Bellowing Herds of Bison
* buffaloes were very useful (used its dried shit for food???)
* 15 million were there after the Civil War
* when railroads were built, the herds of buffalo were massacred bc they took too long to go across the tracks...
* the First Nations had no food, so they surrendered to reservations

#### The End of the Trail
* two sides: humanitarian (treat them kindly) and hard-liners (forced containment + punishment) - neither respected culture
* Christian reformers would teach at reservations (starved them and forced them to give up tribal religion..?)
* Dawes Severalty Act of 1887: dissolved tribes as legal entities, wiped out tribal ownership of land, gave 160 acres to individual Indian family heads
	* bad for them because they had a lot of reliance on tribally held land

#### Mining: From Dishpan to Ore Breaker
* Conquest of Indians + introduction of railroad was good for the mining business
* Eventually was taken over by big corporations who had a lot of wealth from stockholders
* Individual gold washers became day laborers
* Having precious metals helped finance the civil war, advance the railroad industry, and resulted in more conflict with Native Americans

#### Beef Bonanzas and the Long Drive
* Long Horn cattle we killed mostly for their hide (but improved after railroads) --> to Chicago and butchered
* Railroad "made the longdrive and killed the longdrive" because railroad brought in homesteaders and sheepherders 
* Blizzard also killed cattle
* Cowboys weren't who they perceived to be in real life

#### The Farmersâ€™ Frontier
* Homestead Act - gave people 160 acres of land to improve on
* many people used it to make new homes, but others bought land from railroads, land companies, etc.
* was a "hoax" because they were inadequate in places with no rain (like Great Plains)
	* CORPORATIONS would also bribe "dummy homesteaders" to get the best land with many natural resources
* Railroad companies developed the agricultural industry by selling cheap land they got from the government to settlers
* also discovered that the "Great American Desert" was NOT sterile and people populated there quickly
* Many people died and lost their land due to drought in Kansas + Colorado + Montana
	* to adapt, farmers developed a technique of "dry farming", weather-resistant strains of wheat, barbed wire

#### The Far West Comes of Age
* Federal government kicked native Americans out and confined them to aa narrow corner of Oklahoma so that settlers could use the fertile land there

#### The Fading Frontier
* The frontier slowly started to disappear because people saw it as an "escape valve from their old lives" originally, but now it was all sectioned out, made into states, and populated
	* end of a "romantic" phase of internal development
	* safety valve theory has some merit because it led immigrants out west (stopped them from clogging job markets in the East)
	* Chicago, Denver, and SF became new safety valves where "failed farmers, busted miners, and displaced easterners" found fortunes

#### The Farm Becomes a Factory
* Farmers use to just farm for everything they needed to survive, but now high prices forced them to focus on single cash crops like wheat or corn + use their profits to buy food at the store
* Farming was also mechanized and automated with new machines and steam engines
	* it drew marginal farmers off land + make industrial workers higher ranked
* California had productive land from Spanish Mexican land grants
	* had chinese and mexican immigrants work there

#### Deflation Dooms the Debtor
* when farming became one crop economy, they followed the "southern plantation pattern" - "grain farmers were no longer the master of their own destinies", instead they were very competitive with other grain in the world
* main issues were low prices and deflated currency - made people think of farmers as cheats
* inflation killed many of their businesses

#### Unhappy Farmers
* insects like grasshoppers also ravaged prairie farms
* floods resulted in erosion
* later droughts and abandonment of towns
* farmers were taken advantage of by large corps + middlemen took a large cut from the selling price of farmers
	* at the mercy of harvester trust, barbed wire trust, fertilizer trust
* farmers fought against consolidation, regimentation, and economic integration
