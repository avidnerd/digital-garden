--------

#### The Clash of Cultures on the Plains
* Migration and conflict between Native American Groups in the West
* White intruders spread diseases after westward expansion
* fed gov tried to sign treaties with "chiefs" of "tribe" (even though most native Americans were just nomadic) --> marked beginning of the reservation system (separated Indians into colonies in the north and south)
* Indians only surrendered after being promised supplies and food (but they were given deficient products)
* There was frontier warfare between Indians and the US army in the west (1/5 of all US Army personnel were Black)

#### Receding Native Population
* Aggressive wars w Native Americans in the West - Fetterman's command of soldiers were massacred by Indians in the Fetterman Massacre
* ended up being ghettoized on reservations --> "preserved cultural autonomy" but were considered "wards of the government"
* buffalo were exterminated --> killed nomadic life

#### Bellowing Herds of Bison
* buffaloes were very useful (used its dried shit for food???)
* 15 million were there after the Civil War
* when railroads were built, the herds of buffalo were massacred bc they took too long to go across the tracks...
* the First Nations had no food, so they surrendered to reservations

#### The End of the Trail
* two sides: humanitarian (treat them kindly) and hard-liners (forced containment + punishment) - neither respected culture
* Christian reformers would teach at reservations (starved them and forced them to give up tribal religion..?)
* Dawes Severalty Act of 1887: dissolved tribes as legal entities, wiped out tribal ownership of land, gave 160 acres to individual Indian family heads
	* bad for them because they had a lot of reliance on tribally held land
