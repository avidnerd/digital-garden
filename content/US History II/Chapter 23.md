• How did racial tensions increase during this time period?

• How did the Kearneyites react with the arrival of Chinese to California?

#### The Hayes-Tilden Standoff, 1876
* people wanted Grant to run for a third term, and he wasn't against it, but the House almost unanimously voted "no" because it was tradition to run for 2 terms --> avoid dictatorship
* Went to Hayes (unknown Rep from Ohio - swing state) and Tilden (put away Boss Tweed)
* There was a standoff because the electoral returns were irregular and there were 2 sets of returns (probably some sort of tampering and/or fraud), and if it went to the Speaker of the House, the Democrats would win vs President of the Senate - Republican would win

#### The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction
* Compromise was that Hayes would take office as long as federal troops were taken out of the South, effectively ending Reconstruction
* Sacrificed freedmen rights and black equality
* Civil Rights Act tried to prevent racial discrimination in jury selection, but it was "born toothless" and was deemed unconstitutional in the Civil Rights Cases of 1883
	* 14th Amendment only prevented GOVERNMENT violations, not individual civil rights violations

#### The Birth of Jim Crow in the Post-Reconstruction South
* "Redeemers" resumed political power and established white supremacy
* Blacks faced unemployment, eviction, lynching
* were forced under the sharecropping system, where their former masters were now landlords
* Crop-lien = food and supplies in exchange for some land
* Jim Crow Laws were legal codes of segregation
	* Southern states stopped Blacks from voting by adding literacy requirements, poll taxes, and voter-registration laws
* Plessy v. Ferguson advocated for "separate but equal", but they were not equal at all.

#### Class Conflicts and Ethnic Clashes
* Beginning of class warfare + background of depression and deflation after the panic of 1873
* Railroad strike = railroad companies cut wages and employees went on a strike --> exposed weakness in labor movement
	* Chinese and Irish
* Kearneyites (Irish) did not like the arrival of Chinese in California due to competition of cheap labor
	* engaged in violence
* Congress eventually shut them out by passing the Chinese Exclusion Act (prohibit further immigration from China)
	* some even tried to strip native born Chinese of their citizenship, but 14th amendment offered *jus soli*, or "right of the soil"
