The Populists and the Progressives, though emerging in different periods and with distinct roots, shared some common goals but diverged in their overall approach and political worldview.

### Areas of Agreement:
1. **Government Intervention:**
   Both movements rejected laissez-faire policies. The Populists, originating from disgruntled farmers, and the Progressives, largely middle-class reformers, wanted the government to regulate major sectors. Populists called for government ownership of railroads and telegraphs to prevent monopolies, while Progressives wanted to curb corporate power through state intervention and breaking up trusts.

2. **Direct Democracy:**
   Both movements sought to make the government more responsive to the people. Populists advocated for the direct election of U.S. senators, a demand later realized with the 17th Amendment during the Progressive Era. Progressives expanded this idea further, promoting direct primaries, referendums, and initiatives to give citizens a more direct role in legislation.

3. **Labor Reforms:**
   Both movements supported labor reforms. The Populists advocated for a shorter workday to prevent "wage slavery," while the Progressives pursued broader workplace reforms, such as child labor laws, factory safety regulations, and workers' compensation.

### Areas of Disagreement:
1. **Class and Focus:**
   The Populists were predominantly farmers from the South and West, representing rural discontent and advocating inflationary policies like the unlimited coinage of silver. In contrast, Progressives were primarily middle-class urbanites, who were less focused on monetary policy and more on urban social reforms and curbing the excesses of industrial capitalism.

2. **Scope of Reform:**
   The Populists were more radical in their demands, seeking comprehensive economic changes, including a graduated income tax and nationalized industries. The Progressives, while critical of unchecked corporate power, aimed to "cleanse" capitalism rather than overhaul it. They believed in reforming the system from within, whereas the Populists sought more fundamental structural changes.

3. **Racial Attitudes:**
   The Populists initially tried to unite poor white and Black farmers but later turned to white supremacy as a strategy to maintain power in the South, advocating for Black disenfranchisement. The Progressives, though also limited by the racial biases of the time, were generally more focused on issues like women's suffrage and social reform than racial exclusion, though many still held discriminatory views. 

In summary, while both the Populists and Progressives sought to make the government more accountable to the people, their goals and political philosophies reflected their different social bases and priorities. The Populists focused on agrarian issues and economic reform, while Progressives were urban reformers concerned with curbing corporate power and improving living conditions in industrial society.
