### Chapter 23: Political Paralysis in the Gilded Age(1869 – 1896)

#### Garfield & Arthur
* Ruther"fraud" Hayes did not have a party in the election of 1880 
* dark horse candidate was Garfield --> partner was Stalwart Chester Arthur (supported patronage and corrupted government positions)
* Garfield barely won (bc of the state of New York + Conkling's influence) --> waved the bloody shirt (emotional calls to avenge those who died in the Civil War)
* Died by the hand of Charles Guiteau 
* Benefit was that the spoils system was reformed by none other than Chester Arthur
* Bc he died, Republican party also reformed --> Arthur passed the Pendleton Act of 1883, which made mandatory campaign contributions from federal employee illegal + established Civil Service Commission (require competitive exams to take job positions)

#### The Blaine-Cleveland Mudslingers of 1884
* Maine politician Blaine finally got the nomination, but Cleveland won 

#### “Old Grover” Takes Over
* Cleveland supported laissez faire + hands off government

#### Cleveland Battles for a Lower Tariff
* tariffs were very high in order to give pension to Union veterans and protect American industry (most of government's income came from tariff)
* Cleveland wanted to lower tarriff to give monopolies less protection and lower prices for consumers
* When cleveland proposed, it divided the two parties a lot prior to the election of 1888


#### The Billion Dollar Congress
* first time in US History where congress appropriated 1 billion dollars

#### The Drumbeat of Discontent
* Populists: came from the Farmers' Alliance of annoyed farmers in the West and South
* Goals
	* They wanted inflation through unlimited coinage of silver to make it easier to pay off debts
	* They wanted graduated income tax (why do I have to pay the same as someone who has more money than me?)
	* They wanted government owned railroads, telegraph, telephone (no monopolies!)
	* They wanted direct election of senators (no state legislature)
	* One term limit on presidency
	* shorter workday (no wage slaves!)
	* immigration restriction (protect our jobs + not get replaced by cheap labor!)
* Organized the **Homestead Strike** against Carnegie's Homestead steel plant
* The appointed James Weaver as nominee but industrial laborers did not make a good enough showing
* The south also had complaints but they did not participate that much in the Populist Party because of the amount of black people there
* Slowly the Populist Party turned super racist + advocated Black disenfranchisement


#### Cleveland and Depression
* Cleveland got elected again and a huge depression came about
* unlimited coinage of silver weakened American credit
* Gold reserve in the treasury went to 100 million even though it supported 350 million of paper money
* Repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act (government had to purchase a lot of silver every month)
* Cleveland went to JP Morgan and convinced the bank to give the government 65 million in gold --> partially fixed stuff

#### Cleveland Breeds a Backlash
* people were upset with cleveland because of his shady exchange with JP morgan
* Wilson Gorman tariff was grudgingly passed by Cleveland (tax on incomes over 4000)
