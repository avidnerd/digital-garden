"At a hackathon, time ceases to exist in the normal sense. Hours blur together as you dive deep into your project, and before you know it, the sun is rising, and you’re still in the same chair, wearing the same clothes, wondering where the night went. There’s a strange beauty in that, in losing yourself in something so completely that you forget to eat, forget to sleep, forget that the rest of the world is still out there, ticking along at its usual pace"
