*Individuals* are the objects described by a set of data.

*Variables* are any characteristic of an individual.

Variables can either be categorical (into multiple groups) or quantitative (takes numerical values for it to make sense to find an average)

The *distribution* of a variable tells us what values the variables take + how often it takes those variables

Relative frequency tables are the relation of a category to a whole.

| Can be used when representing frequencies relative to a whole             | Can use side by side bar graphs for comparing conditional distributions (or segmented bar graphs) |
| Are difficult to make by hand (especially when there are many categories) | represent each category as a bar                                                                  |
| NOT good for checking relationships between variables                     |                                                                                                   |

No-no's for Bar Graphs:
* Do not use pictographs
* always start at 0 on the scale 

Different types of distributions:
* Marginal: distribution of one variable among all individuals
* Joint: probability of two things happening together 
* Conditional: probability of one variable happening GIVEN the presence of another variable.

Association: There is an association between two variables if one variable can help predict the other.
