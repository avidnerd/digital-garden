A system :: an object or group of objects we are studying
**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUcLfuGDAldfyzk1IyiTtelJLF-jhF64CXCq-K6gVjsF1vuf1c7c9KcSFjF6GBo9OLaRE4TLOkXbw8stkVu7eqVqD5x3TqkIAk-Q1Zes2CV3V37HhTPMM4sLl8hm7gXy_aSBpTtIr_aFG0MKMQV7drDQ4O-rn6Y=s2048?key=9BlR9f0ii6ceD0MFqmdkVA)
ex. The dog is moving with respect to the ground, but not with respect to the turtle - depends of frame of reference**

What are the criteria for a reference frame to be established? :: 1. an origin in space, 2. an origin/zero in time, 3. a coordinate system

What is the only time a system can be defined as moving? :: when a reference object is identified

When are point-like objects used :: when the size and shape of an object is irrelevant to analyzing a scenario.

The *position* of an object is? :: a vector that describes the object's location in relation to the origin. 

The *displacement* of an object is? :: the change in an object's position from one instant in time to another

What is the difference between distance and displacement? 
- Distance is a scalar quantity, while displacement is a vector quantity (has direction)
- For example, if Ana travels 5m to the left and 2 meters to the right, her **distance traveled** would be 7m, while her displacement would only be -3m

#### Velocity

Velocity is? :: the rate of change of position

Acceleration is? :: the rate of change of velocity

the three models of motion are? :: mathematical model, position time graph, motion diagram

If the XvT graph has a constant rate of change, the velocity is constant.

If not, there is acceleration.

What does the slope of the tangent line to a Xvt graph represent? :: the value of the object's instantaneous velocity at that moment

How to calculate the average velocity within a specific time interval? :: It is the slope of the secant line between two points (formula: $\Delta x / \Delta t$)

How to estimate the instantaneous velocity of a point? :: find two very close points that are equidistant to the point and find the average velocity of those points.

What if velocity is not constant?
* speeding up: magnitude of velocity is getting larger
* slowing down: magnitude of velocity/speed is smaller

The *displacement* of an object is? :: the change in an object's position from one instant in time to another

How do you calculate an object's displacement during a time interval (e.g using a velocity time graph)?
	it is equal to the area between a velocity time graph line and the time axis between two clock readings

if you want to calculate the displacement of c, make sure you account for the fact that areas under the t-axis are negative!

You can also use the same method of calculation when the velocity is not constant.

#### Acceleration

Key questions to consider about acceleration:
1. If an object is speeding up, does that means that its acceleration must be positive? :: No. an object will speed up if its acceleration is in the same direction as its velocity
    

2. If an object is slowing down, does that means that its acceleration must be negative? :: No. an object will slow down when its acceleration is in the opposite direction of its velocity.
    

3. Is it possible for an object to have a non-zero velocity and zero acceleration? :: Yes. This occurs when an object has constant velocity (rate is not changing therefore acceleration is 0)
    

4. Is it ever possible for an object to have zero velocity and a non-zero acceleration? :: Yes. If the velocity is changing direction then it should eventually become 0, even though the slope of the line is still nonzero --> still accelerating. It can also happen when an object starts moving from rest

A small cart is rolling freely on an inclined ramp with a constant acceleration of 0.50 $m/s^2$ in the –x-direction. At time t = 0, the cart has a velocity of 2.0 m/s in the +x-direction. If the cart never leaves the ramp, which of the following statements correctly describes the motion of the cart at a time t > 5s?

(A) The cart is traveling in the +x-direction and is slowing down.
(B)  The cart is traveling in the +x-direction and is speeding up.
(C)  The cart is traveling in the –x-direction and slowing down.
(D) The cart is traveling in the –x-direction and speeding up.
