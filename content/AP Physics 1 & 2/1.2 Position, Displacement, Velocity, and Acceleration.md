The *position* of an object is a vector that describes the object's location in relation to the origin. 

The *displacement* of an object is a vector that starts from an object's initial position and ends at its final position.

What is the difference between distance and displacement? 
- Distance is a scalar quantity, while displacement is a vector quantity (has direction)
- For example, if Ana travels 5m to the left and 2 meters to the right, her **distance traveled** would be 7m, while her displacement would only be -3m
