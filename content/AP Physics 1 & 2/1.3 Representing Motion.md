Motion is a change in an object's position *relative to the user* during a change in time. 

#### Reference Frames
Motion is relative because describing motion depends on the position of the observer, and requires a *reference frame*.
* A reference frame includes an object of reference, a coordinate system with a scale for measuring distance, and a clock to measure time.
* The object of reference must have a specific **point of reference**, to describe where the object is on the coordinate system.
* The coordinate system should include 1+ coordinate axes, and an origin at the point of reference
* The clock should have an origin of time called t = 0

#### Motion Representations
There are different ways to model motion:
- Linear motion - when an object (considered point-like) is moving in a straight line
